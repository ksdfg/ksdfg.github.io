Over the last 20 out of 30 days I was on my bike for a distance of 1750 km, which included stretches from Pune to Varandha and back, Pune to Goa via Diveagar and Goa to Pune via Nipani. Here's what I've learnt.

## Role reversal

While I have been a petrol-head for over a decade now, my passion has always been cars. That's not to say I didn't enjoy hooning around on two wheels before - Buttercup, my trusty Vespa, is the centre piece of many core memories on the road. But for me, a two wheeler was always a secondary vehicle, something to take when the car wasn't available or didn't make practical sense. So when I walked into the showroom 10 months ago, it was with a clear plan: I was here to get a bike that would become my weekend toy for short rides. These would be routes I had already explored with Bluejay, my i20 N Line, which would now become my partner on longer tours to faraway horizons.

Fast forward to current day, and the roles have switched completely!  I've come to realise that Bluejay is like a high performance athlete: give her a proper track and she'll put Usain Bolt to shame. But Fern, my new Scrambler 400X?  Fern is an unstoppable mountain goat. Bluejay still accompanies me on the same old ghat runs that I used to, but Fern has become my go-anywhere machine. I feel more confident exploring the unknown on two wheels compared to four, when roads devolve into broken roads until I'm asking myself "are we on a road?"

I had never considered the possibility that I'd want to use a bike for travelling long distances. I only figured out how I wanted to ride by _going out and riding_. _A lot_.

When I took delivery of Fern (my lovely Scrambler 400X) in January this year, I had some very clear plans for it. Fern was to be a weekend toy for shorter rides while Bluejay (my i20 N Line) would become my ride for longer trips and tours.

10 months later, it's completely flipped: the car now does highway stints, city chores and shorter rides on perfect tarmac, while the bike has become my go-anywhere machine. I'm a lot more comfortable exploring new places on a bike than I am in a car.

I had never even thought of using my bike for travelling long distances when I bought it. I only figured out how I wanted to ride my bike by _riding it_. _A lot_. More on that later.

## Where the road ends

Honestly, Fern was a purchase made by the heart and not the mind. For a short, stubby weakling like myself, the Speed 400 was the obvious choice to go for. The shorter seat height and the road biased tyres would be significantly better suited to my _intended_ usage. However, there was just something about the big bike stance and the bassy rumble of the exhaust that drew me to the Scrambler.

I always saw the 19 inch front wheel as something that I had to deal with when I'm riding on road. However, it has become one of my favourite thing about the bike over the last 7000kms, and the last month has just cemented that fact in my mind. I have gone from being annoyed at bad or non existent roads to actively looking for them. I take any chance I can to get up on the pegs and speed through sections that want to shake my skeleton loose. Slipping around in mud in Varandha, flying over broken ghat roads on the way to Dapoli and riding on the beach in Diveagar were some of the best moments of my rides.

While I don't think I'll ever become a MX guy who wants to go on the most technical trails out there, the idea of doing proper adventure riding has become a lot more attractive. In my car and my old Vespa, bad roads would make me frown and sigh. Fern just makes me smile wider.

## Big bikes

I had bought Fern as my first step into the world of motorcycling. She was always supposed to lead into me getting a proper "big bike": initially a Speed Twin, and as I started doing more adventure riding these ambitions shifted to the Tiger 900 and the Transalp 750. However, this month of riding has proven to me that 40 bhp is more than enough.

There have been times on all of my rides when I have been on a nice highway with good tarmac and no other vehicles in sight. This is the only time when I'm going WOT on any machine, and when I have done so Fern has been good for 155-160 kph before hitting the redline. On our roads, where most of the traffic is at 100-120 kph, this isn't just fast; it's as fast as I will ever feel safe going. Any faster than this and I'm no longer riding: I'm hoping.

Does this mean I want to stay with Fern forever? No, I'd still like to switch to something that feels more refined in the higher portions of the rev range, and with some more QOL features like inbuilt navigation. The new batch of 450cc parallel twin ADVs coming to India seem tasty. But this is all the power I will ever need.

## When plans fall apart, Adventures begin

While I'm not a guy who plans every second of his trips, I like to research a lot and figure out what's the best before I actually do anything. [You don't make a detailed sheet for riding gear without having some level of weaponized autism](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ptbgbtLeGuINHm8FYstZfc0SUECGa6c0JTiACO-bks?usp=sharing). Over this last month, there have been multiple cases when things haven't necessarily gone to plan. While this should have annoyed me in theory, in reality this is what made the rides so memorable.

The first time I did the Varandha ride, I went solo and it took me a little over 6 hours to get back home. Just a couple stops to take photos, and mostly non stop riding. When I went back next weekend with my friends, it took me twice as long and it was a much more memorable ride because of it. My friend's 390 Adventure started overheating due to the radiator becoming covered in mud (we had a little too much fun XD), and we spent the rest of the ride literally splashing water on the radiator to cool it down. I panicked a little in the beginning, but we're all engineers - cooking up a jugaad solution is literally our job description. We were laughing our heads off every time we stopped to waterboard the rad. Our friend not noticing as his parked bike just toppled over was just the cherry on the cake.

The multi-day tour was originally a Konkan tour going across Diveagar, Harihareshwar, Ganpatipule, Kunkeshwar and then back to Pune via Nipani, with a stop in Kolhapur. I had mapped out routes for each day of riding, with places for us to take rest stops. This plan lasted all of one day, when we realised that while the roads were fun, there wasn't really anything to do in these places for 3 dudes with a shit ton of luggage and gear and nowhere to stash it. On the first day, as we sat in our hotel room resting, we immediately began trying to figure out what else we _could_ do. Within an hour, our Konkan tour became a Goa trip, something that I've been trying to do for 2 years at this point. New plans were made within minutes, and we decided that we'll decide the exact route to get back from goa when we get there. This completely changed the vibe of the trip, and for the better. We chilled at a cafe where a random uncle pulled out a guitar and started singing, we got to visit the RE cafe (cool bikes, meh food) and i finally got to play in the water on a Goa beach. Even when google maps took me on a completely different route on the way back from Goa to Kolhapur, we just laughed it off and reconvened near Nipani.

But it wasn't all smooth sailing.

## Different strokes for different folks

The whole reason that the Konkan tour became a Goa trip was because of a fundamental difference in how me and my friends look at trips. For me, the destination is ultimately meaningless - it's just an arbitrary goalpost that I marks how far along I've come. The reason I'm riding is _just to ride_. All I want are good roads that are fun to tackle, with a side of beautiful scenery to stop and gawk at. It's a philosophy that I've inherited from my father, and it dictates everything - how I plan, when I decide to take breaks and why I didn't foresee conflicts with my friends.

Not everyone thinks alike. While this is a very obvious statement, it gets lost in the excitement of exploring new opportunities you never realised existed. While I am a tourer, my buddy is more of an explorer. To him, a tour is riding to get to places, to explore the destinations. Our core conflict was that there wasn't really much to do in our rest stops in the way I had planned it. He wanted to do more than just ride on the highway, maybe look at an empty beach and move on. It was fundamentally different to what I wanted to experience, and in our excitement to get this trip on the road we hadn't even considered that we were looking at this in completely different ways.

The key to resolving conflict is always to find a compromise. We chose Goa because we've always wanted to go there (our previous ride was ruined by heavy rainfall in peak summer and a typhoon warning). I gave up on my need to stick close to the coast the entire time (which was a good decision, the highway was beautiful) and he was happy to just cafe hop in Panaji when we reached there, and figure out what to do the next day over some mock-tails and coffee. And in doing so, we both enjoyed the trip much more than if we had just stuck to the original plan.

## I have a lot of Baggage

When planning for the multi-day tour, I packed what I thought was necessary - a hoodie, jeans and shoes for wearing when we go out, a pair of shorts and some t-shirts for lounging in the hotel rooms, thermal liner for riding in the cold mornings. My friends packed much lighter: one wore sports shoes while riding his scooter, while the other just threw in cheap slippers to swap out from his riding boots and track pants that he could wear in and out of the hotel room. I stuffed everything into a nearly 2 decade old duffel bag on my pillion seat, with a shoulder strap that's too short and has zero padding.

The difference became painfully apparent at Harihareshwar when we walked to the viewpoint. My friends grabbed their backpacks and set off, while I had to untie my entire setup. With my jacket tied to the bag, all that weight concentrated on one miserable point on my shoulder as I waddled up like an overloaded pack mule. I can't wear the jacket either - I naturally run very hot and would genuinely dehydrate trekking around in Indian heat. I ended up having to take multiple breaks both to and from the view point, physically dying trying to keep up with them. Part of this is my lack of fitness (those 10,000 steps a day aren't going to walk themselves), but even for someone in better shape, lugging around all that gear at every stop would get old fast. The constant attaching and detaching just added insult to injury - my friends were always ready to leave before me, waiting while I fumbled around with straps and bungee cords.

Looking back, most of what I carried was unnecessary. The thermal liner got used for maybe an hour across four days. The extra shoes could have been slippers, or skipped entirely - my riding boots aren't hardcore enough that I can't wear them under jeans and walk around. Heck, I could just remove the armour from my riding pants and roam around in what are essentially cargos. A simple cycle lock could secure the bag straps, jacket lapel and helmet to the bike when we stop. I need to figure this out so I can step off unburdened when exploring new places. The whole point of these trips is freedom, but I'm too busy carrying around baggage from my past decisions to actually enjoy it.

## Some purchases are necessary

Over the course of this last month, I have spent a lot of money, time and effort modifying my bike. I added aux lights, since a smooth-brained koala is brighter than the OEM headlight. I installed new handguards from Rynox, since the stock ones had broken when I dropped my bike while standing still, and that resulted in the broken guards holding my brake lever being the closed position. I increased the preload to deal with my portly Indian uncle build.

Every time I swiped my card, there was a twinge of guilt. A part of me said that I don't need these things, that it's just compensating for skill. People tour on bare-bones splendours for god's sake. But the other part of me was vindicated when we started riding through heavy fog out of Dapoli, and the aux lights became life savers as others could actually see me. The unnecessary hand guards gave me the peace of mind to tackle more difficult terrain, knowing that I wasn't going to have to drive hundreds of kilometres with a broken lever. The preload adjustment, as insignificant as it initially seemed, allowed me to truly enjoy the roads as my bike no longer wallowed around over bumps.

However, not all purchases are necessary.

## Others are just retail therapy

When I was initially buying my gear, I was just trying to get the bare necessities. Back then, I just wanted this to be a tarmac toy, and I went about outfitting myself accordingly. This has led to some ragrets.

I bought the Cramster Flux jacket because it matched my requirement of Level 2 armours, and because it fit the retro aesthetic I was trying to go for. This last month, I've spent a significant portion of my time gaslighting myself into believing that this wasn't the right choice for me, and that I needed to upgrade to a touring jacket. I came up with all kinds of reasonable arguments for this - the relaxed fit means that I can get a much smaller size that will fit my frame better, the extra pockets means I can carry an extra shirt and cap to wear on stops without having to rely on backpacks or other's storage compartments, I needed better protection for the longer tours that I now want to go on.

This eventually led to me selling my Cramster jacket the weekend after I got back, and buying a new Reise Moto PineAir jacket the very next day. I'm very happy with my new jacket - downsizing from a 3XL size street fit to a L size touring fit did wonders for my ego, and the Safe Tech armours are barely noticeable compared to the clunky Cerros ones. But I'm in no illusions about why I bought this jacket - not because I needed it, but because I couldn't stop thinking about it. This was money that I could have spent on petrol to ride more, time I could have spent on researching routes instead of jackets. I failed to draw the line between need and want, and it will sting me for a while.

## Conclusion: Just ride

This was my most intense month of riding so far, and it taught me far more than I expected. I learnt that I don't need more power, that I love riding where roads don't exist, that my friends and I travel differently, and that I'm far too susceptible to retail therapy for my own good. But the biggest lesson? I had no idea what I actually wanted. I thought I knew - a weekend toy for ghat roads, and nothing more. It took 1,750km across 20 days to cement what riding actually means to me, and in turn, learn a lot about who I am as a person.

None of this came from reading blogs or watching videos or planning meticulously. It came from just riding. A lot. Theory can only take you so far; at some point, you need to throw a leg over the bike and figure it out for yourself.

You've just spent the last few minutes reading words of questionable wisdom from a random buffoon on the internet. I now urge you to shut off the screen, get on your bike, and have your own intense month of riding. Maybe you'll discover you're a tourer like me, or an explorer like my buddy, or something completely different. The only way to know is to **_just do it_**.

See you on the road. Ride safe!
